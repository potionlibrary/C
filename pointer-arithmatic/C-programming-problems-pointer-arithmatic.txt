Sure, here are three problems that involve pointer arithmetic and memory manipulation in C, arranged in order of increasing difficulty:

1. Write a C program that uses pointers to swap the values of two variables. 
   This is a classic introductory problem that helps you practice basic pointer syntax and usage.

2. Implement a function in C that performs an in-place reversal of a null-terminated string. 
   This requires you to use pointer arithmetic to manipulate memory directly, and can be challenging to implement correctly.

3. Implement a dynamic memory allocator in C, similar to malloc() and free(). 
   This involves more advanced pointer arithmetic and memory management concepts, such as maintaining a free list and coalescing adjacent free blocks of memory.

Each of these problems requires you to use pointers and manipulate memory directly, but the difficulty level increases progressively. The first problem is relatively straightforward and is a good starting point for beginners, while the third problem is more advanced and requires a deeper understanding of C memory management.
